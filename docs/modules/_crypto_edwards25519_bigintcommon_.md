## Index

### Variables

* [BIG\_1\_SHIFTL\_20](_crypto_edwards25519_bigintcommon_.md#big_1_shiftl_20)

## Variables

### BIG\_1\_SHIFTL\_20

• `Const` **BIG\_1\_SHIFTL\_20**: bigint = BigInt(1) << BigInt(20)

This is a port of the Go code from https://github.com/hdevalence/ed25519consensus
which is an extension of https://github.com/golang/crypto/tree/master/ed25519
which is in turn a port of the “ref10” implementation of ed25519 from SUPERCOP
