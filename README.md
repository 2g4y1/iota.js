# IOTA Javascript LIBRARY

This is the official Javascript library for the IOTA Core. It implements both the [official API](https://iota.readme.io/), as well as newly proposed functionality (such as signing, bundles, utilities and conversion).

## Installation

Once you've built the dist with gulp, you can either use `iota.js` or the minified version `iota.min.js`. Will add bower support soon.
